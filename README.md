# Terraform Route53 module

This module is not to be deployed directly.

Limitations:
- All resolvers of the same type shares the same security group rules.
- All resolvers must have an exact number of 2 IPs. This cannot be worked around in Terraform 0.11.
- There is no way to auto accept resource shares with the aws provider 2.18.
Thatâ€™s why the resource shares created with this module must be accepted manually on receiving accounts.
- AWS does not offer a way to auto-accept zones associations between account.
In the case zones must be shared between VPCs of different account, this should be done manually until this is solved: https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/617.
See this https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/route53/create-vpc-association-authorization.html for manual handling.
